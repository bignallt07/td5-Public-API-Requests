# td5-Public-API-Requests
This app uses a public API from randomuser.me to display 12 random profiles on the page with some contact information. Upon clicking on one of the profiles a model window will appear which you have the ability to navigate through. You can also refine your search by using the search bar to check for specific names.

## Motivation 

This project was designed in line with project 5 of the Treehouse TechDegree and as a part of my developer portfolio

## Build Status

This piece is completed, meeting the exceeds standards of the Treehouse techdegree.

## Code Style

JavaScript

## Features 
1. Fetches API from randomuser.me and generates HTML of 12 profiles
2. Each profile is clickable, which opens a modal window
3. The modal can be navigated through by clicking the previous and next buttons
4. Use the search bar to refine your search within the 12 profiles

Important Note: On scripts line 231, I have purposely left the console.error in the code to show visitors the details of the error


## CSS Changes
1. class: card - Removed the solid border and added a box shadow to add a popping effect to the cards
2. body - background color changed to a warmer gray
3. header h1 - color changed to work with the background color of the body
